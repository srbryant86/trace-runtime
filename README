# TRACE Runtime Release (0612a)

**TRACE** is a system for cognitive formalism and structured reasoning. This release includes core runtime assets for TRACE’s public-facing infrastructure, integration hooks, SDK scaffold, and deployment-ready web assets.

---

## 🔍 Overview

TRACE is built to encode **reasoning as a visible structure**. It reflects the *structural path from premise to convergence*, enabling clarity, cognitive rigor, and formal resolution across human and AI workflows.

This release represents a vault-sealed export of the active TRACE stack as of **June 12, 2025**.

## 🧠 TRACE Philosophy

> "Reasoning should not only be sound—it should be visible."

TRACE encodes:
- **Premise Anchoring**
- **Slope-Based Convergence**
- **Formal Reasoning Paths**
- **Resolution Tapering**
- **Cognitive Structure with Verifiability**

This aligns with *cognitive formalism*, *logic architecture*, and *epistemic integrity*.
